### Hi I`am Sayeda. ðŸ‘‹
I am an ux designer and a front-end developer. 

I am passionate about art and craft. Hence I ventured into this field of UX design to fulfill my aspiration of designing user-centric products. Front-end development helps me bring my interactive designs in action.

Many years of experience in banking and service sectors taught me to take challenges and underdstand clientsÂ´/ customersÂ´ needs, goals and pain points with empathy. My previous experiences also help me to develop solutions tailored to specific needs of the clients.

I aim to create solutions which are easily accessible to users of all ages and backgrounds including those who are having physical or cognitive limitations in their life.
